## Introduction
This project involves developing a JetBot, powered by the Jetson Nano, to recognize numbers using the SSD MobileNet V2 neural network. The JetBot is designed to identify license plate numbers and match them with information provided by users through a mobile application interface.

## Features

-   **Jetson Nano Platform:** Utilizes the computational power of the Jetson Nano for real-time processing and number recognition.
-   **SSD MobileNet V2:** Implements the SSD MobileNet V2 model for efficient and accurate number detection.
-   **Mobile Application Interface:** Allows users to input license plate information through a user-friendly mobile application.
-   **Integration with JetBot:** Ensures seamless communication between the mobile application and the JetBot, enabling real-time updates and interactions.

## Requirements
This project needs the following python libraries:

 - firebase-admin
 - jetbot
 - jetson-inference
 - jetson-utils
